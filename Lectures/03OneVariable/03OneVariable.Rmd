# Outline

- Nominal/Ordinal Data
  - Bar 
  - Lollipop
  - Pie/donut
- Numeric data
 - Box plot
 - Histograms
 - Kernel density

```{r,include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python('~/anaconda3/bin/python3')
matplotlib<-import('matplotlib')
matplotlib$use("Agg",force=TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align='center',echo=FALSE,message = F,warning = F)
```

# Motivation

- Understand the distribution of a variable
  - Find outliers
  - Find multi-modality
  - Find skew
- Understanding the distribution is about generating interesting questions for further analysis.

# Categorical variables

---

# The bar chart

- The categories are displayed on one axis (usually x).
- The *frequency* of each observation is displayed on the other axis (usually y).
- The frequency is mapped to the *length* of each bar.
- For this reason always include zero on the y axis.

---

# Examples

- We will use two dataets that can be directly loaded from the `seaborn` package.
  - The `taxis` dataset with data on pickup and drop off locations, fares, payment type etc., in New York City.
  - The `diamonds` dataset with information on size, cut clarity, price, etc. of diamonds.
- These contain nominal, ordinal and numeric variables.  

---

# Taxis data

```{python,echo =T}

import seaborn as sns
taxisdat = sns.load_dataset('taxis')
taxisdat
```

---

# Bar plot of pick up

```{python,echo =T, out.width="50%"}
sns.countplot(data = taxisdat, x='pickup_borough')
```

---

# Change orientation

```{python,echo =T, out.width="50%"}
sns.countplot(data = taxisdat, y='pickup_borough')
```

---


# Order by frequency

```{python,echo =T, out.width="50%"}
sns.countplot(data = taxisdat, x='pickup_borough', order = taxisdat['pickup_borough'].value_counts().index)
```

Data are nominal - this is fine.

---

# Ordinal data

- For nominal data it is suitable to order according to frequency.
- This is not the case for ordinal data
- Always  order according to categories of the variable.
- Diamonds dataset has clarity as an ordinal variable
  - Categories ordered as IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1.

---

# Diamonds data

```{python,echo =T, out.width="45%"}
diam = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
diam
```

---

# Ordinal   

```{python,echo =T, out.width="45%"}
diam = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
sns.countplot(data=diam,x='clarity')
```

Categories ordered by levels of variable - this is fine.

---

#Incorrect plot

```{python,echo =F, out.width="50%"}
sns.countplot(data=diam,x='clarity', order = ['IF', 'I1', 'SI1', 'SI2', 'VS1', 'VS2', 'VVS1', 'VVS2'])
```

Incorrect. Categories in alphabetical order.

---

#Incorrect plot

```{python,echo =F, out.width="50%"}
sns.countplot(data=diam,x='clarity', order = ['IF', 'VVS1', 'VVS2', 'VS1', 'VS2', 'SI1', 'SI2', 'I1'])
```

Incorrect. Ordered by frequency.

---

# Single color

```{python,echo =T, out.width="50%"}
diam = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
sns.countplot(data=diam,x='clarity',color='tab:blue')
```

---

# Coloring

- Although by default categories have different colors this is not strictly necessary.
- Arguably it is distracting, especially when there are more categories.
- Later on we will use color to display data
  - For example grouping by a second variable and mapping that to color.
- This will be covered later on.

---

# Lollipop charts

- If there are 
  - A large number of categories,
  - If the categories all have similar frequncies,
- then consider using a lollipop chart.
- This can be done with some data munging using `value_counts` and the `stem` function in `matplotlib`.

---

# Data preparation

For simpler graph, will only consider dropoff in Manhattan

```{python, echo=T}
freq = taxisdat[taxisdat['pickup_borough']=='Bronx'].value_counts('pickup_zone')
freq
```

---

# Lollipop plot (code)

```{python, echo=T, eval=F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.stem(freq)
plt.xticks(range(1,len(freq.index)+1), freq.index, rotation='vertical')
plt.show()
```

---

# Lollipop plot (output)

```{python, echo=F, eval=T, out.width="60%", message = F, results='hide'}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.stem(freq)
plt.xticks(range(1,len(freq.index)+1), freq.index, rotation='vertical')
plt.show()
```

---

# Pie charts

- Pie charts are considered to be poor practice by visualisation experts since
  - It is difficult to compare sizes of angles.
  - It is difficult to make comparisons unless categories are close.
  - They do not handle large numbers of categories.
- Following examples come from a [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6) by Walt Hickey.

# How to do pie charts

.pull-left[
- If you absolutely MUST do a pie chart a guide can be found at this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-pie-chart-in-seaborn/).
- A donut chart is a pie chart with a hole. It is even worse than a pie chart.
